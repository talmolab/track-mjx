    "1. Clone the repository with the following command:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/talmolab/track-mjx.git && cd track-mjx\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This will install the necessary dependencies and install the package in editable mode.\n",
    "3. Test the environment.\n",
    "    Active the conda environment that was just installed:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda activate track_mjx\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Then run `jupyter lab` and execute the tests in [`notebooks/test_setup.ipynb`](notebooks/test_setup.ipynb). This will check if MuJoCo, GPU support and JAX appear to be working.\n",
